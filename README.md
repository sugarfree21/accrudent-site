# OG AccruDent Website

AccruDent was started in Summer of 2024 as the premier DSO consulting and services company. At that time I started building this website so that we'd have a good online presence. I've never been a front end web developer, so learning Bootstrap and getting everything to look just right was a challenge, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

The biggest problem was, creating the website took a lot of effort, and eventually I reached a point where it wasn't sustainable. I had real clients to serve and just couldn't devote hours and hours to keeping the website up to date. I decided to migrate to a no code solution so that others could pick up the site and I could focus my efforts where they matter most: on our clients. 

The upside here is that I can now make the codebase for the site public so that anyone can enjoy!

## Hosting

A version of this site is now hosted at https://og.accrudent.com. Feel free to check it out there!

## Use

Feel free to use anything I've developed in your own work, I really don't care. That's what open source is all about ;)

## Docker

If you want to host the site locally, just run `docker compose up` from the root directory of the project, then access the site at http://localhost:12345.
